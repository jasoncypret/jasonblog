When I first joined remote teams functioned separately without good collaboration. I was able to spark a flame and was able to be impactful of change. I was able to impact change by leading by example. I was a key member of teams that were crucial in developing what BloomBoard is and how they function Today.</p><p>I’m a thinker and maker who thrives on ambiguity and challenging problems. Let me take you through some of the journeys I had with BloomBoard over the last 2 1/2 years.</p><div class="three-photo"><img src="../../images/bloomboard/fun.JPG" class="lazyload lazyload" width="1280" height="960" alt="Fun" /><img src="../../images/bloomboard/papers-f97119cb.jpg" class="lazyload lazyload" width="4032" height="3024" alt="Papers" /><img src="../../images/bloomboard/sightglass.JPG" class="lazyload lazyload" width="3264" height="2448" alt="Sightglass" /></div><h2>R&D Group</h2><p>When I started I was brought on to a scrappy R&D team. The goal was to quickly develop several products, launch, and gauge product market fit, and gather user feedback.</p><p>We were a separate group from the rest of BloomBoard and were able to do things that were previously not possible by the rest BloomBoard. I came in a hit the group running.</p><h2>Topsoil</h2><p>The main product we wanted to test was topsoil. It was a goal setting app that you can track steps on goals, collect ideas, collaborate with mentors, and get peer feedback.</p><p>I was performing dual roles at this time. UX and design, as well as front and back end implementation. The stack was a Ruby/Rails backend powered by angular on the front end.</p><p>I designed, implemented, and tested in rapid succession. We were able to launch Topsoil in a really short period of time</p><p>Developed first style guide</p><h2>Re-thinking our product offering</h2><p>Core team for new product</p><p>Built first version prototype for sales and kickstarted transition to react</p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7df0bfdf89e6437fb9861cd313a2f25d" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><p>Deep UX / User research</p><p>Initial site launch</p><p>mc's</p><p>Cross team style guide (Atomic Design)</p><p>programs</p><p>Component based style guide (CSS Modules BBUI)</p><p>Prototype next big thing from bloomboard</p></div></body><script src="../../javascripts/all-8fbf35e7.js"></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
