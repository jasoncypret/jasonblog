  description: "<p>From a team of one to a department embedded in every corner of the company, building UX at Power was a lesson in scale, culture, and momentum. We didn't just grow fast—we grew right. With intentional recruiting, clear career paths, and a strong leadership bench, we transformed UX from a support role into a strategic driver.</p>

<p>Our culture became our product: daily stand-ups, dual-track agile rituals, onboarding that empowered, and systems that sustained. What started as a whisper of \"design\" became a drumbeat across every team in the company.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;We didn't just bring in designers—we built an environment where design could thrive.&rdquo;</blockquote>",

Our onboarding playbook meant every new hire could ship confidently within weeks. And with dual-track agile, we built the right thing—not just the thing that was spec'd.</p>

<p>Retention soared. Designers stayed not just because of the work, but because of the environment. UX became a sought-after discipline across the company, influencing hiring, engineering, and even how product was scoped.</p>",
