  description: "<p>Not every problem needs a prototype — but our biggest wins all started with one. These were the major product initiatives where UX led the way through ambiguity, validated the path forward, and laid the foundation for game-changing apps.</p>

<p>With Home Tour, we redesigned a critical step in every customer project. With the Inventory Scanner, we connected physical product flow with digital tracking. Each helped set new patterns that influenced Nitro-wide standards.</p>

  description: "<p>We didn't build these apps in a vacuum. Home Tour took 3 years of research, testing, iteration, and simplification before it launched. It replaced a legacy window-measuring tool and is now used on every project. The design helped frame everything: from how to capture data to how to structure handoffs to engineering.</p>

<p>The Inventory Scanner combined hardware and software in a tight loop. It allowed us to manage the full warehouse lifecycle of window products—from truck delivery to bay placement. And its UI design was so modern and usable, it influenced other Nitro interfaces for years to come.</p>",
