  description: "<p>From COVID-19 disruptions to 3D visualization breakthroughs, this lab created space to experiment, prototype, and prove what's possible. UX R&D at Power wasn't just an after-hours side hustle — it was a core function of how we planned, pitched, and accelerated the future.</p>

<p>We made room for safe, low-risk exploration inside a mature org. That breathing room enabled some of our most creative outputs: from remote sales tools to internal design knowledge hubs and fully 3D-rendered product configurators.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Not every idea shipped, but every idea sharpened the team. And many became the future of our platform.&rdquo;</blockquote>",

  description: "<p>The innovation lab wasn't just a sandbox — it was a pressure cooker. We took on near-term strategic bets, using design and prototyping to unlock big moves ahead of engineering. It was a place to trial the hard stuff: new platforms, new modalities (like 3D), or tools that didn't have an owner yet.</p>

<p>Virtual Appointments showed how to rethink an in-home model during COVID. Huddle became our design team's source of truth. The 3D Door Builder proved that sales configurators didn't have to feel like a slideshow. All were built with tiny, fast teams — and many went straight to production.</p>",
