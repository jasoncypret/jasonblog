  description: "<p>Playbook started as a <strong>scrappy style guide</strong> and became a multi-language design system powering every PR in Nitro. We went from Bootstrap overrides to a fully responsive system in Rails, React, and Swiftâ€”adopted across teams and trusted by engineering.</p>

<p>By pairing live code with <strong>Figma kits</strong> and prioritizing usability, we shipped faster and more consistently. The system now gets <strong>2M+ downloads</strong> a year and supports everything from dashboards to mobile apps to internal tooling.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Playbook isn't just a system of components. <br/><br/>It's a system of thinking.&rdquo;</blockquote>",

<p>The system became a shared language. It reduced churn between design and engineering. It helped us prototype ideas in hours, not weeks. And it became a foundation for AI prototyping, templates, and new workflows.</p>"
