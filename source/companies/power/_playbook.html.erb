  description: "<p>Playbook started as a <strong>scrappy style guide</strong> and became a multi-language design system powering every PR in Nitro. We went from Bootstrap overrides to a fully responsive system in Rails, React, and Swift—adopted across teams and trusted by engineering.</p>

<p>By pairing live code with <strong>Figma kits</strong> and prioritizing usability, we shipped faster and more consistently. The system now gets <strong>2M+ downloads</strong> a year and supports everything from dashboards to mobile apps to internal tooling.</p>
