  description: "<p>Pulse was our first major consumer-facing product. It started with a vision: make the chaos of home remodeling feel calm. From kickoff to launch, we ran rapid UX research, stripped away complexity, and shipped an experience customers love.</p>

<p>The dashboard became a daily ritual for thousands. With over 567k users and 13k+ deep engagements, Pulse changed how we connected with customers—and proved that internal systems can lead to external delight.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Pulse didn't just track the project. It gave customers control.&rdquo;</blockquote>",

<p>The result was a clean, mobile-first dashboard that let users preview doors, confirm details, and feel confident every step of the way. Pulse became a surprise delight in a space where expectations were low.</p>",
