I helped launch new apps, prototype emerging ideas, and evolve BloomBoard's entire front-end stack—all while modernizing design culture and scaling consistency through systems. From Angular to React, from individual prototypes to BBUI, I was there at every pivotal shift—leading design, writing code, and introducing new ways of thinking."
