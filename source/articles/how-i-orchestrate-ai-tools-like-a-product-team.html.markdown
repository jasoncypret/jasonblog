  Instead of relying on one AI tool to "do it all," I've found success treating each AI app like a teammate with a defined roleâ€”solution architect, developer, and creative support. Here's how I orchestrate ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, and Figma into an AI-enhanced workflow.

> **tl;dr**â€‚Don't wait for one tool that can do it allâ€”build your own AI squad and assign each role. You'll move faster, stay in control, and spend more time on the parts of product development that actually excite you.

## One AI to rule them all? That's a trap.

Everyone's waiting for *the one*: a magical AI tool that designs, writes, codes, and deploys while you sip cold brew.

That's not how I work. And honestly, I'm not sure I want it to be.

Instead, I've found a much more realisticâ€”and scalableâ€”approach: **treat each AI tool like a teammate.** Give it a specific role. Let it shine in the right part of the workflow. Stay involved in the things only you can do.

## Here's how I orchestrate my "AI team"

When I kick off a new feature or idea, I think like a PM first.

### 1. **ChatGPT = Solution Architect**

I always start by thinking like a product manager:  
*"As a user, I want [X] so that [Y]."*

Then I describe the current contextâ€”what's in place, what's missing, and what the desired experience should feel like. I plug that into ChatGPT (or Claude) and ask it to play prompt engineer:  
> "Turn this user story and background into a detailed technical brief."  

ChatGPT excels here: it identifies edge cases, suggests data models, and sometimes even catches things I missed.

I'll often prime the model with screenshots, style guidelines, or example interactions from Dribbble or my own app. This is where I shape the big picture.

### 2. **Cursor = Senior Developer**

Once I have a solid brief, I move into the codebase with Cursor.  

Cursor helps me:
- Find relevant files across my Rails monolith
- Scaffold new components or endpoints
- Write tests I'd otherwise forget
- Catch inconsistencies or unhandled logic

It works best when I've already thought through the logic. Think of Cursor like a skilled devâ€”you still need to lead.

### 3. **Me = Product/UX Lead**

Here's where human me steps in:
- Review and refine UI in **Figma**
- Pull references and patterns from the design system
- Spot where brand, voice, or user flow needs love
- Time-box feedback loops so I don't endlessly iterate

The goal isn't perfection on pass oneâ€”it's momentum. Good enough is often great enough to ship, test, and then evolve later.

## Why orchestration beats over-reliance

When you assign roles, a few good things happen:

| Benefit | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Each tool stays in its lane** | ChatGPT thinks big. Cursor stays close to code. Figma keeps the UI grounded. |
| **You don't lose control** | You're not handing the whole project to a single black box. You're staying in the loop. |
| **You can upgrade in pieces** | Swap Claude in for ChatGPT? Easy. Test new AI dev tools? Go for it. You're modular. |
| **You can scale faster** | Each tool adds leverage. Together, they 10x youâ€”without replacing you. |

## Pain points and workarounds

Yes, even orchestration has bumps.

- **Lost context?** â†’ Save prompt templates. Include links to brand, design, and past work.
- **AI goes rogue?** â†’ Define "do not use" libraries, patterns, or file paths.
- **Too many options?** â†’ Time-box decisions. If I'm stuck more than 30 mins, I zoom out.

## Recent "wow" moment

I'd been avoiding a Stripe subscription bugâ€”nervous it might mess with money.  
But this time, I walked through it with Cursor + ChatGPT.

We reviewed docs, explored the code, scaffolded a fix, and tested itâ€”all in a single focused afternoon. No panic. No rabbit hole. Just fast, accurate work with great backup.

## Advice I'd give a junior teammate

If you're just getting started with this stack, here's what I'd say:

1. **Learn what makes a good user story.** Break ideas down into small, testable pieces.
2. **Use different tools for different hats.** Treat ChatGPT like a PM, Cursor like a dev, and Figma like your UI pair.
3. **Create chat "roles."** One conversation might be your solution architect. Another is a tech writer. Another is your QA. Label them. Revisit them.

The clearer *you* are, the better your tools can support you.

## Final thought

Don't wait for one tool to do it all.

Orchestrate the tools you've already got.  
Assign them roles.  
Stay in the loop.  
And use your best human skillsâ€”judgment, taste, curiosityâ€”to guide the whole show.
