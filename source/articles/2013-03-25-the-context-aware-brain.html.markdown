Recently I had a conversation with a friend of mine about Taskk. We discussed how we both use Taskk for very different things. The conversation soon turned into, "Wouldn't it be cool if [Taskk](http://taskk.it/) did _____?" Some interesting ideas were thrown around and I thought I'd share and get feedback.

Ok, so picture this, it's the weekend and a beautiful day out. I've got some time to accomplish something.

> *“Hey Taskk, it's gonna be a nice day out…what should I do?" Taskk says: "It is a great day, you should mow the lawn or fly a kite."*

Wouldn't that be awesome? What if it's raining out, and Taskk could suggest to read a book or do some writing? Well Taskk is not Siri, but there's no reason we can't create something similar.

**Context aware scheduling & tagging**

I've had a similar idea for a long time. Say I've allotted 4 hours a day for Taskk and I get home and find that I've got extra time. No problem, let's see what I can do:
*Oh, all I see are suggestions for what I can do at work. I guess I'll just find something from my home list scheduled later in the week, or I can go to my list and manually select a taskk.*

**Wait, shouldn't the Brain just know what context I'm in?**

The Brain is smart, but sadly we haven't taught it to learn context. We're adding the ability to tag your tasks in [version 2](https://dribbble.com/shots/1669896-Taskk-Manage) of Taskk. Now that we have tags, we can begin to implement context aware tags.

### Weather context

Weather is the first tag context that we could accomplish. You can then add these tags like sunny, rainy, snowy, to your tasks. When the weather is good, Taskk will know to schedule those good weather tasks.

Context aware tags could be expanded even further in the future to include location, time, and mood. The different context possibilities are just a matter of which products we integrate next.

So, what do you think about context tagging & scheduling? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
