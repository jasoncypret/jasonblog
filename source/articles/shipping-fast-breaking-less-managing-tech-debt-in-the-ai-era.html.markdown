summary: >
  AI helps you build faster than ever, but if you're not careful, you'll pay the price later. Here's how I keep speed high without letting tech debt pile up—and the simple rules I follow to make sure AI-generated code doesn't bite me in the long run.

> **tl;dr** AI can ship fast. Like… *really fast*. But if you don’t layer in structure, intent, and human refinement, that speed can come at a steep cost.  
> Move fast—but pay your future self by building in check-ins, code patterns, and feedback loops from the start.

## 1. “Vibe Coding” Is Real—and Risky

Right now, we’re seeing people with no traditional coding background *vibe* their way into working apps.  
That’s a good thing—for speed, creativity, and access.  
But…

AI is often great at making something **work**, not making it **right**.

If you rely purely on a single AI tool to generate your code (especially without proper structure), you’ll likely pay the price later:
- In feature collisions
- In unscalable patterns
- In "where-the-heck-is-this" code chaos

## 2. Speed ≠ Sloppiness

Here’s the pattern I use when building fast features for BoxBoard while still keeping my codebase clean:

### ✅ Small updates only  
Even though AI wants to do *a lot* at once, I try to **chunk my changes**. One idea per commit, even if it’s minor.

### ✅ Refactor checkpoints  
After a set of commits, I take a beat and do **human-driven polish**:
- Break long views into partials or components
- Normalize CSS
- Re-structure messy logic
- Apply naming consistency

### ✅ Design first, refine later  
For views and layout:
- I let the AI **scaffold** the initial pass
- Then I **refine layout and CSS patterns** manually  
Especially if it’s custom. Tailwind-based React projects? AI does great. Custom-markup Rails views? I take the lead.

## 3. Use AI Tools as a *Team*, Not a Single Brain

If you’re just throwing code into one AI, you’ll miss the power of *roles*.  
Here’s how I think about it:

- **Builder AI** – ChatGPT or Cursor helps write initial logic  
- **Reviewer AI** – Claude or even another ChatGPT instance checks for structure, naming, or optimization  
- **Me (Human)** – Guides structure, product vision, UX thinking, and subtle polish

This approach prevents bad code from compounding. One AI builds. One reviews. I lead.

## 4. Add Rules When You Find the Gaps

AI learns from you—if you train it right.

Whenever I find myself **fighting** an AI-generated pattern (especially with CSS or file placement), I create new rules:

> ❌ "Don't create random files in `app/assets`."  
> ✅ "Use `app/frontend/components` for reusable JS and CSS."  
> ✅ "All new views should use the `BoxboardLayout` and follow X pattern."

I keep a **living prompt primer** and reference it in each session.  
I’ve even created **diagrams** of my folder structure and included that as visual input to help the AI better understand the app.

## 5. AI Is Speed. You Are Structure.

The best way to think about it is this:

| AI Strengths | Your Role |
|--------------|-----------|
| Rapid scaffolding | Set the vision |
| Syntax + boilerplate | Shape the structure |
| Suggestions | Define the rules |
| Getting unstuck | Know when to pause and rethink |

## 6. Final Thought

Yes—AI can help you ship a working MVP in a day.  
But *someone* is going to pay the tech debt bill eventually.  
That someone might be you... in two weeks.

So set the structure early. Build fast. Refactor often.  
And treat your AI tools like junior engineers—great at execution, but always in need of guidance and a good product lead.
