You can configure My Blog by modifying the `config.rb` file in the project root directory. Make sure to update the necessary settings before running the application.

This is a [good starter template](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-templates-blog) to study.

# Image Gallery

The site includes an image gallery feature with lightbox functionality. Images are automatically processed to create optimized thumbnails.

## Image Processing

### Thumbnail Generation
- Thumbnails are generated at 2x resolution (400x500) for retina displays
- Quality is set to 90% for optimal file size/quality balance
- Thumbnails are automatically generated during build and server startup
- Thumbnail files are named with `_thumb` suffix (e.g., `image.jpg` â†’ `image_thumb.jpg`)

### Regenerating Thumbnails
To regenerate all thumbnails (e.g., after changing image processing settings):

```bash
bundle exec rake images:regenerate_thumbnails
```

This will:
1. Delete all existing thumbnails
2. Generate new thumbnails at the current settings
3. Process all images in the `source/images/companies` directory

### Image Gallery Usage
To add an image to the gallery:

```erb
<div class="image-gallery">
  <%= gallery_image "companies/power/Playbook-Figma.jpg", alt: "Power Playbook in Figma" %>
</div>
```

The gallery will:
- Display thumbnails in a responsive grid
- Open full-size images in a lightbox on click
- Support keyboard navigation (ESC to close)
- Maintain page scroll position when opening/closing

### Image Requirements
- Original images should be placed in `source/images/companies/[company]/`
- Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- Recommended minimum size: 800x1000 pixels (for 2x thumbnails)
